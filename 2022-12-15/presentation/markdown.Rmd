## <span>.</span>Outline

- Recap of the September meeting

- Machine learning

- Deep Learning

- Code Surgery : Image recognition (`R` with `CPU`) 

In December:

- Software and hardware for Deep Learning

- Code Surgery : Voice recognition (`Py` with `GPU` / `TPU`)

The purpose of ML is to replace a human in some tasks while the purpose of DS is to explain the world to a human. Both still use the same concepts.

Deep Learning is Machine Learning using Artificial Neural Networks. 

The "deep" adjective refers to multiple layers in a network.

- Model explainability (loans)

In the [EU](https://www.eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/credit-risk/guidelines-on-loan-origination-and-monitoring) and in particular in [PL](https://www.knf.gov.pl/knf/pl/komponenty/img/Komunikat_UKNF_ws_prawa_do_uzyskania_wyjasnien_nt_oceny_zdolnosci_kredytowej_wersja_szczegolowa_70332.pdf)
the bank must provide information on the measures that the applicant should take to remove the negative effects determining the lender's decision not to grant the loan.

- Theory (it works, but why?)

- Cyber threat (vulnerability to hacking and fraud)

- Reliance on human microwork (Amazon Mechanical Turk)
